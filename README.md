# AES-128-Encryption-Core
A comprehensive technical implementation of a hardware-based AES-128 encryption core implemented in the Verilog HDL. The primary objective was to architect a secure, efficient, and reusable IP (Intellectual Property) core for FPGA implementation, capable of performing high-speed data encryption as specified by the FIPS-197 standard.
